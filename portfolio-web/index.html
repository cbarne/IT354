          <h4>Values and Types</h4>
          <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
            <h5>isNaN:</h5><br>
            It is the asking of "Is Not A Number" which is automatically true on return unless stated false.
            So for example one can not divide zero by zero since it becomes NaN.
            Yet in the case of examples:<br>
            isNaN(5): Is 5 not a 5 so false
            isNaN('a'):True since 'a' is not a number
            isNaN(null)it will be false since it starts at 0.</p>

          <h4>Unary Operators</h4>
          <p class="text-black-50 mb-0"><h5>Plus - Minus:</h5><br>
            The plus helps to change the string of numbers, booleans, and null to numbers. It must be an arthmetic type, else it will result in an error.     
            The minus is the exact same except it is producing the negative of the operator.
            So it will look something like this: "int x = -20; // x is -20 int y = +x; // y is -20"<br>
            Delete:<br>
            It will return the boolean value if the property is properly deleted or it simply is returned. It wont work with variables since it returns boolean values, and it will not work with functions.</p>

          <h4>Hoisting</h4>
          <p class="text-black-50 mb-0"><h5></h5>It is when the logical processing gets reversed. So what is at the bottom goes ot the top.
            So something like this:<br>
            x= 5<br>x<br>
            var x;<br>
            Which then calls the 5 from up top as it is declared from the bottom.</p>

          <h5>Arrow Functions</h5>
          Arrow functions are a short way to write a function and are still able to be movable depending on what its used for. It uses the 'fat arrow' as a definer instead of the function declaration.<br>

        <h4>Object</h4>
        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
          <h5>Object Creation</h5>
            They are needed for any kind of Object Language. There are a few different ways to work with objects. All objects in JavaScript are directly from 'Object'. They all have state and behavior. Identifying what an object is is the first step of translating it into your code.
            As an object is singular; it also has modularity which just means it can be written and maintained independently.<br><br>
          <h5>Object Creation - Classes</h5>
          Classes are used differently compared to normal objects and have a specific function to them. Somewhat of a blueprint to a concept. The object itself is a type of structure that makes that concept real.<br><br>

        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0"><h5>Properties and Values Setting</h5>
          In this example it is showing how to set the propertys of the object itself.
          const hobby = new Object()
          hobby.name = "Aquascape"
          hobby.type = "Aquatic Plant and Fish Keeping"
          hobby.price = "Stupid Expensive"
          hobby.fishcount = 2
          <br>
          <br>
          <h5>Literal Object</h5>
         const hobby1 = { name: "Aquascape", type:"Aquatic Plant and Fish Keeping", price:"Stupid Expensive", fishcount:2 } console.log(hobby1, "this is the second example").<br><br>
          <h5>Object Class Creation</h5>
          class myHobby (name, type, price) {
            this.name = name
            this.type = type
            this.price = price }
            
            const hobby = new myHobby
            ("Aquascape", "Aquatic Plant and Fish Keeping", "Stupid Expensive")

      <h4>Prototypal Inheritance</h4>
      <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
        <h5>Attributes</h5>
        When setting up your function you need to make sure you have all of your constructor types inside. Using the 'this' keyword and setting it to itself.<br><br>
        <h5>Functions</h5>
        In the sense of functions, the prototype needs to be defined. Such as Teacher.prototype.greeting = function() would be a fine example. Where the prototype was defined beforehand as an object that was created and now is being called. Once one is ready to run it they simply would do teacher.greeting() like a normal function call.
       <br><br> 
       <h5>`this`</h5>
       It is not affected by prototypes at all. It is always going to be the object before the period. So in the instance of this.name it will always be before it. There are times where a different word is used such as leader.fullname for example.<br><br>
        <h5>"Syntactic Sugar"</h5>
        It just means the class itself will not use the writing property for prototypes. Only reading properties is used.

      <p class="text-black-50 mb-0"><h5>Window Object</h5>
        A window object is a literal representation of an open window in the browser. All global Javascript objects can automatically become members of the window object. Since global variables are the properties of the window object and the global functions are the methods to the window object.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>Global Object</h5>
        As stated before, global objects can automatically become part of a window object. They provide functions, and variables that are avaliable anywhere. Hence the name global. For the typical browser it is known as window since it can be inside of the window object, but for Node.js it is global.

            Like everything you do in life; it can be defined into chapters. Well the coding world works the same way by dividing programs into modules. It helps with maintaining your program. So instead of changing a little thing all over. It allows you to do it all at once. It also allows for reusability. One can also "stitch" together modules known as module bundling. Which is the process of concatenating all of the files into a single one. Which some people also refer to it as minifying.

          <br>
          <br>
          <h5>The Importance of HOF</h5>
          Higher order functions accept a function as a arguement or is returned as a function. Known to many as a function operating on other functions. Think a boss with his coffee. They all for us to go over actions and not just values.

          <h5>The Importance of AA</h5>
          They allow for the shortening of ones code, and the amount of data that needs to be proccessed. The reduction in the amount of code that the website needs to load would be a lot less. Which is a great tool to have with how quick websites need to load.</p>

        <h4>API's</h4>
        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
          <h5>What is an API?</h5>
          API stands for application program interface which is just a bunch of routines, tools for software building, and much more. There are different types of API's as well. One can use them for youtube, google maps, and even 
          applications such as flickr. They are meant ot make the life of the developer have an easier time. They also can control things such as the flow of access to hardware, or software functions.
          They are mainly used just to facilitate the communication between application and service though most of the time.

          An example of code showing what would be a login API is: <a href="img/firebasecodeexample.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">Html</a>,<a href="img/firebasecodeexample2.png" class="img-fluid" alt=""> JS </a>

         It stands for Representational State Transfer. It has a set of six guidelines that it follows for it to be considered RESTful. The list is as follows: Client-server, stateless, cacheable, uniform interface, layered system, and code on demand.
         Knowing that those are needed; one just needs to understand that if the method for HTTP is different from others. It is fine to do so. Just have to follow the guidelines. Problem is that HTTP and REST are not exactly the same.
         REST uses the URI's for accessing resources which makes them drastically different.

          Postman is an API client collaboration platform that is used for development. It is used to simplify the steps in building an API. Postman helps make api's better and faster by allowing for 
          collaboration. It also allows for automatic testing and monitoring its health at any time. It allows for mock testing which means that one does not need an api key to use it necessarily. It also allows for GET/POST/DELETE/PUT and other request methods.

              <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Defined as a scripting-language specification by ECMA International.</h5><br>
              <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
                Its first initial release was all the way back in 1997. It was designed by a man named Brendan Eich. It was created to help standardize the use of Javascript. Which has lead Javascript to become one of the most used implementers of the scripting language.
It is used for client side scripting and it is used in Node.js quite commonly. Since it is a scripting language, that means that it handles the fundemental actions that a user will input. Similar to a video game character needing to move.
Javascript uses the scripting language as a basis for how it runs its own guidelines. It is like saying you have a constitution to base your guidelines off of. Unless you're a pirate.Since both Javascript aims to be very compatible, it also provides additional features not described in the guidelines. Those are posted in each new version update for more information.

              <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">          
I did not know about the website that he used for simple tutorials. It is nice to know there is short tutorials like that. Also did not know you could auto set the padding or margin to 0 for everything right away. I think it is useful to know that. I did not know flex was actually that useful. It is kind of nice to know that it basically is bootstrap. The simple circle effect could be extremely useful when deciding how I want to use the parrallax effect. The keyframe animation was also a nice touch to see. It may be useful to see that used in my final project as a bubble animation.
Overall I would say it was an extremely informative video showcasing alot of new ideas that I did not know existed. Let alone was aware that simplicity can be that easy. It also left an impression that I need to learn more than I do now about current standards with design. </p>

            <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Tiny Clickable Areas</h5><br>
            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
              Content that is to small to click is not very accessible for users. The hand movement for users is not 100% accurate and some users have issues with seeing small things.</p>
           <br>
           <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Page Titles</h5><br>
            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
              Page titles help determine what the user will find once the webpage has been search on engines like Google. If it is not a descriptive enough title and it is too generic. Users may never come across the webpage like was intended.</p>
           <br>
           <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Content Scanning</h5><br>
           <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
            First rule of web design is does it hurt to look at, is the layout confusing, and is this pleasing to look at? If the page displays items all over the user will not be able to understand how we have it set up. The user reads from top to bottom and the gaze generally zig zags. So focus points are good to have. <br>

            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
              &diams; 2 Second Rule: This rule pertains to the users attention span. If it will not load in two second, than the experience is garbage. So try to keep any type of application launch time under that.
              <br>
              &diams; 3-Click Rule: The user should be able to access most if not all of the information the site needs to offer within three clicks. It shows that there is clear navigation and it shows there is not a mass of clutter.
              <br>
              &diams; Inverted Pyramid: The summary is presented at the beginning of the article rather then the end. Since most users have the attention span of a gerbal, it allows for the meatier substance of information to be at the beginning.
              <br>
              &diams; Don't Use Pop-Ups: It interupts the viewer from what they are doing and potentially nags them to want to leave.
              <br>
              &diams; Don't Have Dead Links: The use of dead links hinders the user from what was meant to be, but never was. It makes them useless to even put in.
              <br>
              &diams; Have Only One Animation Per Page: It can distract the user from the content that is on the page. Making them just as ADHD as kid off his meds trying to study.
              <br>
              &diams; Make Contact Easy: Communication is key. It can lead to missed opportunities, no trust, or even worse the user won't return due to lack of support.
              <br>
              &diams; Make Links Open on the Same Page: User has control and is like a customer. You let them decide what they want to do and not do it for them.
              <br>
              &diams; Ad Banner Blindness: Nobody likes ad's. That includes banner ad's. They are noticed by people, but who really clicks on them nowadays? Nobody, that's who.
              <br>
              &diams; Eye Tracking: It is how the user navigates a webpage just by looking at it. If it is difficult to follow the user will have a bad experience.</p>

            <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Avaliability and Accessibility</h5><br>
            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
              If it does not work, it is garbage. Without users being able to utilize everything, than they become frustated and the site becomes unavaliable. Server uptime is a major player. It helps incoporate the avaliability that your website is up for. Dead links are a big no no once again. Mobile responsiveness is key since most users are on phones instead of pc's when accessing the webpage.</p>
           <br>
           <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Clarity</h5><br>
            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
              Do not distract the users! Simplicity is key. Focus on what is important and familiar to people. Consistency helps with the relative use of clarity as it eases the users mind. Give feedback to every action. Remember Newtons 3rd Law? Same thing is needed for the user to understand what they are doing is what is meant to happen.
              </p>
           <br>
           <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Learnability</h5><br>
           <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
            Making something that has ease of use or can be learned easily. Design has been around for a long time, and people recognize patterns. So with the web, everyone recognizes styles to some extent. Which helps with conceptual design. Making a tutorial unneccesary. Clean and easy to navigate allows for quick access and accessibility as well.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Credibility</h5><br>
            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
              Noone clicks those links that has a weird 2000's era bubble. They are sketchy and screams virus, but sometimes you gotta trust those uncredible sources for things. Most users need to know that you are the real deal and not some virus page. The about us page allows for contact and details for trustworthyness of a site.</p>
           <br> <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Relevancy</h5><br>
           <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
            You need to be relevant. Stay up to date. Know who the target audience is. If you don't know why people are visiting your website, you don't know your audience. Pick a target audience and let that define the web experience for your user.</p>

        <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">          
          It all started out on a webpage that was telling users that Mitt Romney was not running for president. Problem became the word 'not' was unable to be seen. Quite an issue when viewers now think he is. It all began with the font being loaded with a seperate FOIT. Since browsers normally know to load multiple @font-face fonts, it was not thought to happen. These types of incidents can have dire effects on the world we live in today were information is spread like wildfire. I would not think to let the page load before I had already started scrolling to begin reading. So as a user that would be a crucial mishap. It would also ruin the credibility of the source that you read it from. These are ways to address the problem like the article states. I think the most simplist one is simple using one type of font for headers like that instead of relying on multiple types.

            <h4 class="text-white">Node.Js The Javascript Engine</h4>
            <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">What is Node?</h5><br>
            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
              It is a open source, cross plateform Javascript runtime enviroment. It uses the javascript code outside of web browsers. It is built on chromes V8 engine. It is very fast in code execution.
              While also Node.js library being asynchronous allowing for non-blocking to happen. Since non-blocking occurs it also allows for no buffering. Which makes it useful for JSON Api applications and single page.
             </p>
             <br> 
           <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">What does it mean by engine?</h5><br>
            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
              V8 Runtime Engine by Google Chrome is a runtime enviorment that contains the Javascript engine which executes script code. It basically converts the javascript code into a lower tier code that microprocessors can
              then understand. It is written in C++ while being used in chrome and NodeJs. While the V8 engine is running the platform API and DOM are both provided by the browser. It works independently from the browser that
              it is being hosted inside of. Making it a popular engine.
              </p>
           <br>
           <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">History of NodeJs</h5><br>
           <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
            Javascript is 25 years old, and Node is only 11. When compared to the time the internet has been around (which is 31 years) that is 1/3 of its lifetime! In 2009 Node.js was first created. It took until 2011 to make it somewhat popular.
            That is when tutorials for it began to appear. By 2014 it was announced that there was a proposal to make Node.js go open source. By 2017 it had reached mainstream medias attention. It was huge for users and Node.js alike.
            During that time it reached more then 40k stars on github and 3 billion npm package downloads. By 2020 it has become a common used tool in almost every front for the workplace.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="mb-0 text-white-50">Personal Findings</h5><br>
            <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
             My personal belief is that if V8 did not exist then this runtime enviroment would not have taken off. The abilities that the engine allowed for and the amount of attention it recieved by 2017 a mere 8 years after
             is absolutely crazy. It is our modern day make a person famous overnight feeling but it was drawn out silently over the years. To know the impact it has today is also a little astounding to me.
